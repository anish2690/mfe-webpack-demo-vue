# VueJs Module Federation Demo  (WIP)

This example demos consumption of federated modules from a Webpack bundle. `layout` app depends on a component exposed by `home` app.

---

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start` / `npm dev`. This will build and serve both `home` and `layout` on ports 3002 and 3001 respectively.
